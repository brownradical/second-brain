## General info
Everyone would love a personal assistant but that's not reality. As personal assistant technology grows, so does the dependency on it but not all have to be complicated. Something as simple as Second Brain can follow you throughout the day to help you keep on track. With color coordination, automatic date/time change, and the ability to save your scheduled activities. Coding libraries such as Moment.js expand the possibilities to make things like this possible.
